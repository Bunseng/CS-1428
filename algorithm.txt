-Divide the main function into several functions
-Use data stuctures to collect all the function data
-In Global section:
	-declare number of employee
	-use constants size of arrays
	-Declare prototype functions
		-void inputDate
		-void validateData
		-void validateData1
		-void FWE
		-void TAFWE
		-void SRinPercent
		-void Salary
		-void Letter
		-void Report
-Divide data structures into three sections:
	-struct Personal
	-struct Compute
	-struct Employee_Data
-Inside main
	-Ask for employee number
	-Declare an array to employee's number
	-validate file in and file out
	-validate number of employee
	-call the data structure with functions
-Function inputData
	-get a file strings from struct Employee_Data
	-get a file numerics from struct Employee_Data
-Validate strings data
-Validate numberics data
-In FWE function
	-compute the three years and semesters	
-In TAFWE
	-compute the total weighted and average 
-In SRinPercent
	-assigned percent value into proper arrays
	-Calculate salary raise
	-if FWE < 75, display salary raise = 0%
	-if FWE > 75 but <= 80, display salary raise = 1%
	-if FWE > 80 but <= 90, display salary raise = 3%
	-if FWE > 90 but <= 100, display salary raise = 5%
	-if FWE > 100, display salary raise = 10%
-In Salary
	-compute the salary in dollars and total with dollars
	-compute salary raise in dollars
	-if 0%, 90000 * 1
	-if 1%, 90000 * 0.01
	-if 3%, 90000 * 0.03
	-if 5%, 90000 * 0.05
	-if 10%, 9000 * 0.1
	-computer salary in dollars with the raise 
-in Letter
	-stored letters in proper arrays and struct data
-in Report
	-heading 1
	-heading 2
	-name of employee
	-name of supervisor
	-ID#
	-Phone number
	-Address
	-Display 3 years and 3 semester value
	-display final semester for each year
	-dispaly the final weigthed
	-display average final weighted
	-current salary
	-Salary raised in percent
	-in Dollars
	-Total in dollar and percent
-Determine apprciation letter 
	-if FWE < 70, display letter of something
	-if FWE >= 90, display letter of appreciation
	-Else, Display letter of congratulating
